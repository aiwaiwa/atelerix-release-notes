**ATELERIX Head Osei v3** has been repacked to address a few minor issues:
* Assign separate attachment points by default.
* The ears are now shown by default.
* Remove a few animations from Emo HUD that caused the eyes to show through the eyelids.
* Automatically add proper rotation to Emo HUD if moved to another attachment point.
