### ♛ Mouth Osei v3:

New mouth has improved mesh and textures, including new teeth and tongue meshes.

- New mouth follows shape changes — lower teeth no longer poke through the chin, allowing for a wider range of head shapes and characters.

### ♛ Mesh & Rigging Improvements:

- New "Mouth Space" surface allows for completely new or custom teeth to be added if desired.
- Updated lower lip and chin for better deformation!
- Updated upper eyelid rigging for smoother eye closure.

### ♛ Eye and Blink Controls:

- Glint can now be resized or shifted up or down.
- Sclera (eye white) can now be resized or shifted up or down — a critically important feature for making various eye shapes look realistic.
- Adjustable blinking frequency (with the option to turn it off).
- Eyes can be closed using a calibratable eye closer.
- (Emo HUD overrides blinking when needed.)

### ♛ Built-in Animation Controls:

- Ambient animations can now be turned on/off.
- Several Mouth Opener animations (including chew) are now available.

### ♛ Hiders:

- Ears can be hidden separately, which opens the door for mixed addons without the need to wear a **Ear Default** L or R.
