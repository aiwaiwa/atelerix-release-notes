### ♛ Mesh & Rigging Improvements:

- New "Mouth Space" surface allows for completely new or custom teeth to be added if desired.
- Updated lower lip and chin for better deformation!
- Updated upper eyelid rigging for smoother eye closure.

### ♛ Eye and Blink Controls:

- Glint can now be resized or shifted up or down.
- Sclera (eye white) can now be resized or shifted up or down — a critically important feature for making various eye shapes look realistic.
- Adjustable blinking frequency (with the option to turn it off).
- Eyes can be closed using a calibratable eye closer.
- (Emo HUD overrides blinking when needed.)

### ♛ Shapers:

### ♛ Hiders:

- Ears can be hidden separately.
  - Makes it easier to wear just one add-on and keep the other ear as built-in. (Previously, one had to wear an **Ear Default** L or R to achieve that.)
  - Makes it possible to mix-match add-ons that require different kind of hiding.

### ♛ New Swooplet Page Layout

### ♛ Mouth Osei v3:

New mouth has improved mesh and textures, including new teeth and tongue meshes.

- New mouth follows shape changes — lower teeth no longer poke through the chin, allowing for a wider range of head shapes and characters.
